    titulo-seccion: About me
    descripcion: |
      Data engineer with over 3 years of experience working with both Data Warehouses and Data Lakehouses. My expertise lies in data modeling as well as the development and orchestration of ETL processes, all within a work philosophy centered on the use of Spark and SQL technologies, excelling in Azure, Databricks, and Snowflake environments.

      Throughout my professional career, I have demonstrated skills in handling large volumes of data and transforming them into meaningful information that drives strategic decisions üìà.

      I am always seeking new opportunities to grow and learn üéì.

      My goal is to improve how data is sourced, modeled, stored, and accessed. With this approach, I aim to manage and exploit data more efficiently and effectively, increasing its value and facilitating decision-making üß†üöÄ.
